# Example Mod
### An example mod created to try and get new modders to use good code practices
This contains the basic setup for a normal mod, and the included files use good code practices.
### All credits for Forge, FML etc go to their respective owners.
Any code written by me is free for any use at all. Some credit would be nice though :)
Download the repository, follow the directions to install Forge from the README.txt in the root directory and you're ready to go!
### Eclipse Preferences
If you are using eclipse you can go to Preferences and import the helpful-eclipse-preferences file which contains preferences that set up the Java Code Formatter to auto-format your code
