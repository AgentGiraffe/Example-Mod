# Cadiboo_Example_Mod_1_12_2
### An example mod for 1.12 forge version 1.12.2-14.23.3.2655
This contains the basic setup for a normal mod, and the included files (mostly) use good code practices.
### All credits for Forge, FML etc go to their respective owners.
Any code written by me is free for any use at all.
Download the repository, follow the directions to install Forge from the readme.txt in the root directory and you're ready to go!
